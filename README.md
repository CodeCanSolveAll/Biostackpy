# biostackpy

**biostackpy** is a Python package for efficient analysis of very large biological image stacks (>15,000 frames).  
It provides both general-purpose image analysis tools (filters, segmentation, measurements, transformations, etc.)  
and a dedicated pipeline for **Acoustic Force Spectroscopy (AFS)** combined with  
**Reflection Interference Contrast Microscopy (RICM)** experiments.

## Motivation

During my PhD, I study the **viscoelasticity of suspended cells** such as THP1 or K562.  
We use **Acoustic Force Spectroscopy (AFS)** because it delivers stable forces over long durations,  
enabling **low-frequency active microrheology experiments** (0.01â€“1 Hz).  

To capture these experiments, we rely on **Reflection Interference Contrast Microscopy (RICM)** recording,  
which produces extremely large video stacks.  

While tools like **scikit-image** and **ImageJ** are powerful, I encountered several issues:
- `scikit-image` was not designed for efficient **large stack handling**.
- `ImageJ` lacked several functions needed for AFS-RICM analysis.
- I wanted a fully **Python-based, scriptable environment** for flexible pipeline development.
- Performance and memory usage became a bottleneck with datasets in the hundreds of gigabytes.
  
**biostackpy** was created to address these challenges:
- Efficiently handle **large biological image stacks** (via lazy loading and structured data classes).
- Wrap and extend powerful `scikit-image` functions into a **stack-centric workflow**.
- Provide a dedicated, validated **AFS-RICM analysis pipeline**.
